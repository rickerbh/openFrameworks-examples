==========================

A collection of play projects. Everything in this repo is open source, public domain. Go nuts.

Projects
--------

### lineVideo - 2013-05-24
This is my first play with the ofVideoGrabber. Pixel colour analysis, and drawing horizontal lines based on the pixel colour.

### squareVideo - 2013-05-24
Similar to lineVideo, but using squares, to get a blocky feel to the video.

### circleVideo - 2013-05-24
Similar to square, but using circles. I quite like this effect.

### movementVideo - 2013-05-29
I wanted to attempt to get the circles to change size based on movement in the scene. I figured an easy way to do this is to perform some colour analysis on the pixels between renders, and if there is a significant change, then that is a sign of movement. It's not 100% due to the movement detection method, but an interesting effect nontheless.
